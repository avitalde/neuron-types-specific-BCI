## neuron-types-specific-BCI

This GitHub repo contains 3 files
1. `main.ipynb` - Code containing the main analysis done
3. `helper_functions.ipynb` - Where helper methods used in the main analysis are defined
4. `data_collected.ipynb` - Since different analysis can take a long time, and they are needed in multiple places, we save some the output data that is reused in different parts of the code
